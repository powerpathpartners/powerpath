# Quick Fix: Manual Cloudflare Pages Upload

## The Issue
Your API token is missing a permission that allows creating new Pages projects.

## Fastest Solution: Manual Dashboard Upload (No API Needed!)

### Step 1: Get Your Files
You have 3 files ready:
- index.html
- css/style.css  
- js/main.js

### Step 2: Go to Cloudflare Dashboard
1. Visit: https://dash.cloudflare.com/
2. Login to your account
3. Click "Workers & Pages" in the left sidebar

### Step 3: Create Pages Project
1. Click "Create application"
2. Click the "Pages" tab
3. Click "Upload assets"

### Step 4: Upload Files
1. Project name: `powerpath-partners`
2. Production branch: `main`
3. **Upload these files maintaining structure:**
   - Drag index.html to the root
   - Create a "css" folder and drag style.css into it
   - Create a "js" folder and drag main.js into it

**OR** if it allows folder upload:
- Just drag your entire project folder

### Step 5: Deploy
1. Click "Deploy site"
2. Wait 1-2 minutes

### Step 6: Add Custom Domain
1. After deployment, go to your project settings
2. Click "Custom domains"
3. Click "Set up a custom domain"
4. Enter: `powerpath-partners.com`
5. Click "Continue"
6. Cloudflare will automatically configure DNS (since domain is already on Cloudflare)
7. SSL certificate will be automatic

### Step 7: Verify
Your site will be live at:
- https://powerpath-partners.com
- https://powerpath-partners.pages.dev

## That's It! ✅

No API tokens needed. No command line. Just drag and drop.

## Alternative: Fix the API Token

If you prefer to fix the API issue:

### Create a NEW Token with These EXACT Permissions:

**Permission Template:** Use "Edit Cloudflare Workers"

**Or Custom Token with:**
- Account → Cloudflare Pages → Edit
- Account → Account Settings → Read
- User → User Details → Read

**Important:** Make sure "Account Resources" is set to "All accounts" or your specific account.

Then try the Publish tab again.

## Need Files Downloaded?

If you need to download these files from this environment:
1. Look for "Download" or "Export" button in the interface
2. Or copy the content of each file manually
3. Create the files locally with the same names and structure
