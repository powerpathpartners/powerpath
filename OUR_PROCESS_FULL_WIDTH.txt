OUR PROCESS - FULL WIDTH WITH BUILDING VISIBLE
===============================================

✅ CHANGE:

Background Image Display:
- background-size: cover (fills width)
- background-position: center bottom
- Building anchored to BOTTOM of section
- Image fills full WIDTH of page
- Minimum height: 500px to ensure visibility

How It Works:
- "cover" = fills width completely (zoomed wide)
- "center bottom" = aligns building to bottom edge
- Building stays visible at bottom
- Image expands to fill section width
- Top of image (sky) may be cropped
- Bottom of image (building) ALWAYS visible

Visual Result:
✅ Full page width coverage
✅ Building fully visible at bottom
✅ No side letterboxing
✅ Dramatic wide presentation
✅ Gold overlay maintains brand

Trade-off:
- Width: FULL (fills page) ✅
- Building: VISIBLE at bottom ✅
- Top sky: May crop slightly if section is short
- Ideal balance between width and building visibility
