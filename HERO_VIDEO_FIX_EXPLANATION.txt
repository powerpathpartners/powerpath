HERO VIDEO FIX - EXPLANATION & SOLUTION
========================================

‚ùå WHAT WAS WRONG:

The hero section was showing NOTHING because:
1. Video file (hero-video.mp4) wasn't uploaded to GitHub yet
2. No fallback background image was set
3. Z-index layering was incorrect (overlays were blocking video)
4. Dark blue color (#001427) was showing instead

‚úÖ WHAT I FIXED:

1. Added Jerome Background as Fallback:
   - Jerome_Background.png is now the fallback
   - If video doesn't load, Jerome shows
   - Background color as final fallback

2. Fixed Z-Index Layering:
   Layer 1 (bottom): Jerome background image
   Layer 2: Video (z-index: 1)
   Layer 3: Dark overlay (z-index: 2)
   Layer 4: Waterfall animation (z-index: 2)
   Layer 5: Particles (z-index: 3)
   Layer 6 (top): Content - logo, text, buttons (z-index: 10)

3. Proper Stacking:
   - Video plays on top of Jerome
   - Overlay makes text readable
   - Content visible above everything

üéØ RESULT NOW:

SCENARIO A - Video Uploaded:
‚Üí Video plays, overlay on top, content readable

SCENARIO B - Video Missing:
‚Üí Jerome background shows, overlay on top, content readable

SCENARIO C - Both Missing:
‚Üí Dark blue fallback color, overlay, content readable

üìã FILES YOU NEED TO UPLOAD TO GITHUB:

CRITICAL - Must upload both:
1. index.html (fixed)
2. hero-video.mp4 (in outputs folder)

ALREADY ON GITHUB (should work):
3. Jerome_Background.png (fallback)
4. All other images

‚ö†Ô∏è UPLOAD CHECKLIST:

1. Download hero-video.mp4 from outputs folder
2. Download index.html from outputs folder
3. Go to your GitHub repo
4. Upload BOTH files to root (same folder as other files)
5. Commit changes
6. Wait 2-3 minutes
7. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

The hero section will now show:
- Video if uploaded (preferred)
- Jerome if video missing (fallback)
- Always shows content clearly
