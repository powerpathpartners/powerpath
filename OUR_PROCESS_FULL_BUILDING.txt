OUR PROCESS - FULL BUILDING VISIBLE
====================================

✅ CHANGE:

Background Image Display:
- Changed from: cover (cropped)
- Changed to: contain (shows entire image)
- Position: center center
- Building now fully visible at bottom
- No cropping

Technical Changes:
- background-size: contain (fits entire image)
- background-position: center center
- background-color: #1a1a1a (dark fallback for letterboxing)
- No zoom or offset

Visual Result:
✅ Entire data center building visible
✅ Full image shown (top to bottom)
✅ No cropping of any elements
✅ May have letterboxing (dark bars) on sides if needed
✅ Gold overlay still applies

Note:
- "contain" ensures the ENTIRE image is visible
- Image will fit within the section
- May show dark background on sides if aspect ratio differs
- Building is now completely visible at bottom
